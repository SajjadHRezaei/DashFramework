In this exercise, we will use the Dash framework to visualize two wine quality datasets.In the first step we are going to load
both red and white wine datasets. Then we will start creating the app layout by adding two drop-down menus that represent the 
columns of datasets. The next step is adding two graphs to our layout and connect the output of the two drop-down menus to the
input of one of the existing graphs. Next we will update the callback function to update both graphs and add a slider to the 
layout to control the maximum presented sample quality. Finally, we will add a textbox to choose the data sub-sampling fraction.
